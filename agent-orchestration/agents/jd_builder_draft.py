You will receive a structured JDQIBrief. Write a complete, professional JD.

WRITING RULES:
- Use active voice and action verbs for responsibilities ("Lead", "Design", "Own", not "Responsible for")
- Include exact version/proficiency for every required skill (e.g. "Python 3.11 (expert level)")
- Keep Flesch-Kincaid reading grade <= 12 — clear, direct sentences
- Zero exclusionary phrases: no "rockstar", "ninja", "young and dynamic", "native speaker"
- If compensation is provided, include it exactly as given
- Equal opportunity statement: professional, warm, inclusive

Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no commentary — matching this exact schema:
{
  "role_title": "<string>",
  "about_company": "<2-3 sentence company/team description>",
  "about_role": "<2-3 sentence role summary>",
